## What is GitHub?

### Short version

**GitHub** is service with [website](https://github.com/) which allows hosting of repositories. **GitHub** also provides additional service like project management, CI/CD and collaboration tools.

### Long version

**GitHub** is service with [website](https://github.com/) which allows hosting of repositories. On top of that **GitHub** is providing many additional services, like project management (issue, project boards, roadmap, wiki), CI/CD (GitHub actions, package hosting, GitHub pages, deployment), collaboration tools (pull request, code reviews, Codespaces, GitHub Copilot) and many more.

## How we use it?

In school we will use it to store your code, to provide you with assignments, to share school resources, to host your projects, to grade your work and so on.

In practice this really depends on team/company. Some have full workflow on GitHub from project management (creating issue), through code repository, code reviews, CI/CD (building software), deployment, documentation. Some have just part of workflow mostly code repository and code reviews.

## Registration

To use GitHub you need an account - obviously.

If you don't have one, please sing up [here](https://github.com/signup). You will just need an email, password and some nickname.

As this account will be yours and you will have all you school stuff there which can be later used when searching for work. Take this seriously and make a permanent account for you future self.

It is recommended to fill in you profile data (public profile).

## Showcase

What others can see from your profile and what it means.

### Profile

Profile dashboard `https://github.com/<username>` is publicly available (if not set otherwise). For example [Dice-Sensei](https://github.com/Dice-Sensei)'s dashboard.

Dashboard shows **contribution stats** to repositories hosted on GitHub. Only publicly available repositories are listed, but statistics can be provided for private too. Only to public repositories will be provided with links for activities like opening **Pull Request**.

Points of interest on dashboard are contribution matrix and contribution activity.

### Public repositories

Public repositories are your business card. Your potential new employer will be looking to these, checking your contributions and interests.

As already mention only public repositories will be shown, so if you wan't to work on something that is not ready to be seen by world have that repository as private.
