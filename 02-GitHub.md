## What is GitHub?

### Short version

**GitHub** is service with [website](https://github.com/) which allows hosting of repositories. **GitHub** also provides additional service like project management, CI/CD and collaboration tools.

### Long version

**GitHub** is service with [website](https://github.com/) which allows hosting of repositories. On top of that **GitHub** is providing many additional services, like project management (issue, project boards, roadmap, wiki), CI/CD (GitHub actions, package hosting, GitHub pages, deployment), collaboration tools (pull request, code reviews, Codespaces, GitHub Copilot) and many more.

## How we use it?

In school we will use it to store your code, to provide you with assignments, to share school resources, to host your projects, to grade your work and so on.

In practice this really depends on team/company. Some have full workflow on GitHub from project management (creating issue), through code repository, code reviews, CI/CD (building software), deployment, documentation. Some have just part of workflow mostly code repository and code reviews.
